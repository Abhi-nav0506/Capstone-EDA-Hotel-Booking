#### **CAPSTONE PROJECT OF EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) ON HOTEL BOOKING DATASET:**

● Hotel industry is a fast moving industry and if someone is operating in the hotel business, they also
need themselves to be adaptable with this fast moving industry.

● The objective of this project is to analyze the given ‘Hotel Booking Dataset’, in order to see,
understand and gain insights from the factors that govern the bookings in the hotel industry.

● The dataset contains data for two hotels, named: ‘City’ hotel and ‘Resort’ hotel, having data variables
like date, duration of stay, total guests, market segment, is the booking cancelled, is the customer a
repeat customer, deposit type, etc.


**Following were the approaches taken:**
•	Null values in the dataset were inspected and handled. There were four variables with null values.
•	Country based, i.e. Portuguese and non-Portuguese customer analysis was done for both hotels.
•	Market segment & payment mode (deposit type) wise analysis was done for both hotels.
•	Analysis of duration of stay along with average daily rate was done for both hotels.
•	Reserved & allotted room type analysis along with average daily rate was done for both hotels.
•	Analysis of demand along with average daily rate over time was done for both hotels.
•	Analysis of special requests over time was done for both hotels.
•	Analysis of cancelled bookings was done for both hotels taking room type, market segment, payment mode and lead time into consideration.
•	Correlation heat map analysis was done for some other variables.

**Conclusions:**
•	Majority of the customers are Portuguese nationals (28% of overall). 
•	‘City’ & ‘Resort’ Hotels are located in Portugal and ‘City’ hotel is the busier of the two.
•	The retention rate of ‘Resort’ hotel is better for both Portuguese & Non-Portuguese nationals, but it could market on attracting the latter more.
•	“Online TA” market segment is bringing most of the business and majority of the customers prefer paying at the time of checking out.
•	Customer coming to ‘Resort’ hotel are coming for a longer trip.
•	Planning to stay for longer duration is more economical in the case of ‘Resort’ hotel.
•	The most desired room type is ‘A’, followed by ‘D’. Majority of those who didn’t get the room type ‘A’ were allotted the room ‘D’.
•	The ‘demand’ and ‘average daily rate’ trend for ‘City’ hotel is similar, but opposite for ‘Resort’ hotel.
•	Hotels need to focus on cancellations via ‘Online TA’ market segment, because that is where the majority of the ‘No Deposit’ cancellations are and the lead time for “cancelled” bookings is higher than “confirmed”.
•	The majority of the customers are the adult population.
•	Families with babies travel less than the families with grown children.
